### Background

Aisha works as the only UX researcher in a fast-paced SaaS startup. She’s highly skilled and motivated, but being the only voice for UX often leaves her stretched thin. She not only designs and conducts research but also spends considerable time convincing product and business teams of its value. While she enjoys autonomy, the lack of peers and support tools often slows her down.

- Struggles to get buy-in from stakeholders for proper research timelines.  
- Feels isolated and lacks a sounding board for ideas.  
- Limited access to advanced tools due to budget constraints.

- Ready-to-use templates and pitch decks to demonstrate UX value to stakeholders.

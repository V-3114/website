Just a curious guy, who loves to know it all, at least I try to. I don't think I have enough lifespan for it, but anyways, I am 21 and living, so can't stop me here. I want to build cool things, and live a peaceful life, interesting, right? 

I love exploring and experimenting with a force of habit to interact with humans, psychology and observing stimuli.

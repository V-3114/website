**Project**:

AI-Powered UX Research Assistant

**Project Background**:

A tool designed to help UX researchers conduct, organize, synthesize, and document user-centered research efficiently.

**Project Scope**:

    • Primary Users — UX Researchers
    • Secondary Users — UX Designers
    
The first challenge in any design aimed at solving a real-world problem is answering the question: *Why?* Defining a clear problem statement is essential to justify the need for design. It provides direction and a goal to work toward during the iterative process.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Problem Statement</div>

Identifying the major challenges UX researchers face during the research process played a key role in shaping the design decisions and MVP. Therefore, the problem statements served as a solid foundation to keep this design user-centered.

Three virtual user types were selected:

    • UX research aspirants just entering the field.
    • Experienced UX researchers
    • Freelancers/solo designers who often juggle multiple roles, including research
    
The goal was to include diverse potential users with varying experience levels, research methods, and roles—while also ensuring the informed decisions were relevant and within scope.

Based on the user types and the validation of my own assumptions, the following challenges were commonly observed:

    • Unstructured research workflows
    • Time-consuming data analysis
    • Difficulty synthesizing insights
    • Collaboration barriers
    • Scattered research data
    • Bias and subjectivity in research
    
With a clear understanding of the problems we aimed to solve, the first iteration of design could now begin.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Goal Statement</div>

*"How Might We" (HMW)* — a design thinking method popularized by Google — is used to turn problems into opportunities for design.

| Problem                             | Solution                                            |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Time-consuming data analysis        | Automated data analysis                             |
| Difficulty synthesizing insights    | Research synthesis & reporting                      |
| Scattered research data             | AI-powered data organization                        |
| Bias and subjectivity in research   | Bias-detection suggestions                          |
| Collaboration barriers              | Shared boards and comment features                  |
| Unstructured research workflows     | AI-assisted planning for goals and methodologies    |

Contrary to popular misconception, design doesn’t begin with ideation phase. Activities like "How Might We" — although not visual — spark the earliest stages of ideation and establish boundaries to explore creative solutions.

For the sake of readability and flow, this document presents the empathize phase after the problem and goal statements, though it typically occurs earlier in practice.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The MVP</div>

Empathy is a deeply studied concept in design, and while numerous frameworks exist, the key is choosing those that best support your goals and constraints. To bring the identified user types to life, I created <u>Personas</u> — a method of adding emotion and perspective to user data.

I chose not to include empathy maps or user stories, as explained in <u>My Design Framework</u> section.

By mapping user journeys for each persona, the *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)* was defined:

    • Goal definition aid
    • Research plan generator
    • Research analysis assistant
    • Insight summarization
    • Documentation support
    
**Success Metrics**:

    • Time saved in planning and synthesis
    • User satisfaction with insight understanding
    • Clarity and completeness of documentation
    • Return usage frequency
    
With scope, pain points, and goal opportunities clearly defined, the project advanced to the next phase — the part I find most exciting.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Ideation</div>

In user-centered design, it’s essential to validate early ideas using insights from the research phase. One such method used here was <U>Value Propositions</u> — mapping all potential features, categorizing them based on the project’s core values and MVP criteria, and aligning them with specific personas.

This approach ensures that the first design iteration focuses on solving real user problems, rooted in research. Attached value proposition maps further illustrate this process.

I then skipped some early ideation methods, quickly sketched <U>User Flows</U>, Created paper wireframes, and digitized them in Figma for early prototyping.

A single screen was designed for each core feature to keep the interface goal-oriented. Normally, you would test these prototypes with primary research methods. However, in this case, I moved directly to high-fidelity mockups, deferring user testing for future iterations.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Finalization</div>

A successful design must not only function well but also look good. If the design isn’t visually engaging, users may never discover its functionality. While it’s easier to create something visually appealing, the true challenge is achieving that while staying user-centered.
Since the hard part — identifying user needs — was already addressed, finalizing the UI focused on visual design enhancements.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Future Scope</div>

These features were outside the scope of this iteration but could greatly enhance the user experience:

    • Enhanced collaboration tools
    • Sentiment analysis
    • Bias-detection mechanisms
    
**Accessibility Considerations**:

    •To be added — consider listing specific guidelines, e.g., color contrast, screen reader support.

# <div style="text-align: center;">The Learnings</div>

Throughout the project, I experienced a mix of emotions. At one point, I even considered scraping it due to doubts about the validation of design decisions. But a fresh mindset, curiosity, and a genuine interest in understanding the design process helped me push through.

I hope this documentation helped shed light on key aspects of my way of user-centered design. One thing I appreciate about design in general, is that there are no strict rules — practice the fundamentals, and you can build your own Citicorp Center.

# <div style="text-align: center;">Key Takeaways</div>

**Double Diamond Framework (British Design Council)**:

    Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver

Emphasizes divergent and convergent thinking during problem-solving and solution development.

**User Types vs. Personas**:

Understand the distinction — user types act as design anchors, while personas bring those types to life for empathetic design decisions.

Ask:

        ○ Does this user have unique needs?
        ○ Would they use the assistant differently?
        ○ Might they expect different features?
        
If yes, consider defining a new user type. Else, group them together.

**Goal Statements**:

Combine how to implement tasks (e.g., formatting, tagging) with the why (e.g., saving time for insights).
